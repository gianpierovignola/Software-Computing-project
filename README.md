# Software-Computing-project

The aim of this work is to analyze simulated montecarlo data (Signal and Background) of a decay channel of the charmed Î›<sub>c</sub><sup>+</sup> baryon using the ROOT TMVA tool. The [main code](https://github.com/gianpierovignola/project/blob/master/01_TMVA_Program.ipynb) is written in python using Python-C ++ bindings, called PyROOT. <br>
The results were then analyzed by modifying some [ROOT macros](https://github.com/gianpierovignola/project/tree/master/JSROOT) and [presented](https://github.com/gianpierovignola/project/blob/master/02_Analysis_Results.md) with JavaScript ROOT (JSROOT) installed using a free hosting service on a dedicated server: [jsrootsoftwareandcomputing](Https://jsrootsoftwareandcomputing.000webhostapp.com/).

# Folders in the repository
